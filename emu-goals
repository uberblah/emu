This is the specification for Nostalgia's default emu-based processor

Things we care about most...
1) Simplify the exposed API for people who may not know much about existing architectures, or about coding in general
2) Maximize flexibility to allow the broadest possible range of external devices
3) Optimize for speed any time the two goals above are reasonably covered by the API
NOTE: There might not be any opportunities to do REAL optimization, but I need the preceding line to keep me comfortable.

Things we don't care so much about...
1) Making a class structure that looks or behaves like a real processor
